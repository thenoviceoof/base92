# base92

A little library for encoding byte-strings into strings easily
typeable on a standard US 101-key keyboard, with strictly better
information density than base64 or base85 encodings.

# Usage

Fire up your favorite python::

```
>>> import base92
>>> base92.decode(base92.encode('hello world'))
'hello world'
>>> base92.encode('\x61\xf2\x05\x99\x42')
'DJ8gER!'
```

We use doctests, so running the tests is as easy as executing the
base92.py library file with your python.

# Misc

This library is pure python: there may be a cbase92 forthcoming,
backed by a C library.

This library has not been tested with python3.
